*This is a ML model to classify Male and Females using some physical characterstics Data.*
*Python Libraries like Pandas,Numpy and Sklearn are used In this.*

# Visualizing physical characters & diffrences using Graphs and plots

```
#visualising forehead length data
sns.lineplot(data['forehead_width_cm'],data['forehead_height_cm'], hue=data["gender"])

# Accuracy of Various models we trained

**1. Accuracy of Decision Tree is: 96.87%**

It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.
It is a graphical representation for getting all the possible solutions to a problem/decision based on given conditions.

**2. Accuracy of Random Forest is: 97.53%**

Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset.

**3. Accuracy of Logistic Regression is: 97.27%**

Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique. It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables

**4. Accuracy of KNeighbors is: 97.20%**

K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categorie
K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.
